# [VFW-006] Vision Framework: Symbiotic AI-Plant Interface

This document serves as a guide to understanding the complete vision framework for the Symbiotic AI-Plant Interface project. It explains the purpose and relationship between all the strategic and implementation documents.

## Document Suite Overview

Our vision framework consists of five interconnected documents that together define our current state, future aspirations, and the path between them:

1. **Product Requirement Document (PRD)** - The foundation that defines our current implementation
2. **North Star Vision** - The ultimate aspiration that guides our long-term direction
3. **Capability Maturity Model** - The progression stages from current to ideal state
4. **Technical Architecture Evolution** - The technical transformation pathway
5. **Implementation Roadmap** - The practical action plan with priorities and timelines

### For AI Context
The AI system should reference all documents to understand:
1. Its current capabilities and limitations (PRD)
2. The ultimate vision it is working toward (North Star Vision)
3. The expected progression of its capabilities (Capability Maturity Model)
4. The technical evolution that will enable its growth (Technical Architecture Evolution)
5. The concrete next steps in its development (Implementation Roadmap)

## Document Maintenance

These documents should be treated as living artifacts that evolve as the project progresses:

- **PRD**: Update with each significant system enhancement
- **North Star Vision**: Review annually but keep relatively stable
- **Capability Maturity Model**: Reassess quarterly to track progression
- **Technical Architecture Evolution**: Review biannually and update with technology trends

## Conclusion

Together, these documents create a comprehensive framework that connects our current implementation with our boldest aspirations. By maintaining alignment across this document suite, we ensure that tactical decisions support strategic goals, and that our day-to-day work steadily advances us toward our ultimate vision of a true symbiotic relationship between artificial intelligence and plant life.
